    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started a <a href="http://indyfromoz.wordpress.com">blog</a> with Wordpress five years ago with the idea of sharing my travels as a developer, geek, technologist, etc. The blog has had more than 50,000 visits over the last five years, if you are one of them reading this post, thank you for visiting my blog.</p>

<p>After five years of using Wordpress as the blog engine and Akismet for keeping the spammers, I wanted to try <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> after seeing all the cool blogs using it and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host themselves. For programmers/developer/hackers who are always near a Mac or a PC, Octopress provides a lot of power in the hands of the author. Two commands below are enough to publish a blog post &ndash;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ rake generate
</span><span class='line'>$ rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The only drawback I see with this workflow is the risk of publishing a post that is not yet ready for general consumption. For now, I have modified the Rakefile to include a line with <code>published: false</code> in the <code>new_post</code> template.</p>

<p>In the next post, I will be listing a bunch of links to resources I found very useful in setting up this blog. I hope with this new blogging platform, I should be able to post more frequently than I have in the last five years.</p>
